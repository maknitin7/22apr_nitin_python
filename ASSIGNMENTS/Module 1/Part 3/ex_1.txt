Python is designed to be easy to read and understand. It follows a clean and simple structure. Here's how it works:

1. Statements Run Top to Bottom

Python runs your code one line at a time from the top to bottom.

print("Hello")
print("World")

2. Indentation is Mandatory

Indentation means adding spaces at the beginning of a line. Python uses it to know which code belongs to which block (like inside if, for, or function).

if 10 > 5:
    print("True")    # This line is indented — belongs to 'if'
print("Done")        # This line is not indented — outside 'if'

Usually, we use 4 spaces for indentation.

3. Comments Help Explain Code

Use # to write notes. Python ignores comments.


# This is a comment
print("Hello")  # This prints Hello


✅ 4. Variables Store Data

A variable holds a value like a number or text.

name = "Alice"
age = 20

5. Input and Output

input() lets the user type something.

print() shows a message on screen.

name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)

6. Decision Making with if-else

You can run different code based on conditions.

age = 18

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are not an adult.")


7. Repeating with Loops

Use loops to run code again and again.


for i in range(3):
    print("Hello")
